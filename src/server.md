## Git
### Learn
- [ ] [git cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
- [ ] ["Pro Git", free ebook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (**optional**. Chapters 2-3 cover the basics. Chapters 7 and 10 teach you a bit beyond it)

### Practice 
- [ ] [Learn git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). Practice at least until `Moving Work Around`. The rest is recommended but optional.

## Relational Databases
### Learn
- [ ] [**Basic Data Modelling**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fQ-bRllhXc#t=01m50s) ![](../assets/time-30m.png) ![](../assets/tag-video.png)   
  If you wanna design a data model (of tables and fields) for a new application, where do you start from? Begin with a simple diagram of your data structure. Learn about what an ERD (Entity-Relationship-Diagram) is and how to draw one.

- [ ] [**Understand mysql explain query**](https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-mysql-queries-with-explain)
- [ ] [Use the index Luke](https://use-the-index-luke.com/3-minute-test). Take the 3 minutes test, and go through the answers. The rest of the site is also great, with lots to read at later time about db internals.

### Practice
- [ ] get mysql to run on your local computer, either using homebrew or using docker (recommended).
- [ ] Connect to the db, and run some queries, either using cli, or gui tools like mysql-workbench or dBeaver.
