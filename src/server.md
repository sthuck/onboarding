## Relational Databases
### Learn
- [ ] [**Basic Data Modelling**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fQ-bRllhXc#t=01m50s) ![](../assets/time-30m.png) ![](../assets/tag-video.png)   
  If you wanna design a data model (of tables and fields) for a new application, where do you start from? Begin with a simple diagram of your data structure. Learn about what an ERD (Entity-Relationship-Diagram) is and how to draw one.

- [ ] [**Understand mysql explain query**](https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-mysql-queries-with-explain)
- [ ] [Use the index Luke](https://use-the-index-luke.com/3-minute-test). Take the 3 minutes test, and go through the answers. The rest of the site is also great, with lots to read at later time about db internals.
- [ ] [MySQL Indexing: Best Practices for MySQL 5 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeRqU0SlJa4) (optional)

### Practice
- [ ] get mysql to run on your local computer, either using homebrew or using docker (recommended).
- [ ] Connect to the db, and run some queries, either using cli, or gui tools like mysql-workbench or dBeaver.

## Node.js
- [ ] [Don't block the event loop](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/dont-block-the-event-loop/)
## HTTP

### Learn
 - [ ] [Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177), [Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155) - Part 1 covers well-known subjects, go through it quickly or skip to part2

## Dependency Injection and Inversion of control
- if you came from C# or Java you are probably already familiar with this and can skip it. If you used Angular you should also be familiar with it. If all you used is React and express.js this might be new for you. (It's also very common in React, but not discussed as Inversion of control)
- The wikipedia articles are the best I could find :\ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection
- (**optional**) [How to implement your own dependency injection in typescript](https://blog.logrocket.com/roll-your-own-dependency-injection/)

## NestJS + Typeorm
- [ ] [NestJS docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/) read at least `Overview` and `Fundamentals`. If you have time: `TECHNIQUES/Validation`, `SECURITY/Authentication` and `OPENAPI`.
- [ ] For typeorm, you will need the entire documentation at some point or another, but start by going throught just `https://typeorm.io/#/entities` and `https://typeorm.io/#/relations`.

## TDD
We will dedicate a day to TDD later on. Putting links here for reference:

### Learn
- [TDD intro by Uncle bob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58jGpV2Cg50) if are short on time watch from 21 minutes to 1h:15m.
- [TDD, where it all went wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM) - very recommended. How to avoid the pitfalls of TDD, not get "burned-out" by it.
