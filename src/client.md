# Client side technologies reading list
Starting at a new company is an exciting time, it's also a great time to stop and try to upskill yourself a bit.

This reading list covers many subjects, because each new employee is different. You yourself might be familiar with some, and others might be a bit less.

If you see a subject you are very familiar with, feel free to skim through it quickly.

## CSS 
### Learn

- [ ] Go back to the basics of CSS in [Web.dev css guide](https://web.dev/learn/css/). Skip over parts you are familiar with.  ![30m](../assets/time-30m.png) ![read](../assets/tag-read.png)

## Javascript
- [ ] go through [es6 katas](https://jskatas.org/), focus only on subjects you are not familiar with. `Generators`,  `Symbols`, and `Iterator protocol` are common subjects people tend to know less about.

## Typescript
### Learn
We make heavy use of typescript, it's very important to be proficient in it. 
- [ ] [Typescript handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) ![3h](../assets/time-3h.png)

If you have never used Typescript before, please read: `The Basics`, `Everyday Types` and `More on Functions`.

If you have used it before, further your knowledge by reading `Narrowing`, `More on Functions`, and `Type manipulation`.


### Practice
You can use [TS Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) if you need a place to quickly write typescript code.

## React
- [ ] [React as a UI runtime by Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/), a long read but recommended for later when you have spare time ![1h](../assets/time-1h.png) **(optional)**
