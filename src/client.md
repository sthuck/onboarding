# Client side technologies reading list
Starting at a new company is an exciting time, it's also a great time to stop and try to upskill yourself a bit.

This reading list covers many subjects, because each new employee is different. You yourself might be familiar with some, and others might be a bit less.

If you see a subject you are very familiar with, feel free to skim through it quickly.
